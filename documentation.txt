Initial Documentation for salt_check.py

The goal of this software is to enable easy testing of configuration managed servers.  Bluntly, the question of whether what was to be an end state of a server actually happened after setting up configuration managment software system (salt states, ansible playbook, puppet mainfest, chef recipe), and applying the software (salt, ansible, puppet, chef).

Use case: test driven configuration management, without having to program

Example process flow:
- create a test case for a server (e.g. is the right version of apache installed)
- run the test case, and see it fail
- run the config mgmt system (which installs apache)
- re-run the test case for a server and observe if the right version of apache is installed (hopefully it is)

Usage: salt_check.py -L server1,server2 apache_test.tst

Test case syntax:

UNIQUE-TEST-CASE-NAME:
  module_and_function: SALT_MODULE.FUNCTION
  args: 'ARG1,ARG2'
  kwargs: 'FOO=BAR,HELLO=HI'
  pillar-data: '{'X':'Y'}'
  assertion: assertEqual
  expected-return: COMPARE-VALUE

Definitions:
salt_module.function denotes a saltstack execution module and function to call in that module
args are arguments supported by the function
kwargs are arguments keyword arguments supported by the function
pillar-data is a json structure (simple dictionary / hash) containing data (always optional) 
assertions are used to compare what was returned from the salt_module.function to what we expected to get
expected-return is the value we want expect to see returned from the function


Test case example:

correct-version-apache2-installed:
  module_and_function: pkg.version
  args: 'apache2'
  kwargs: ''
  pillar-data: ''
  assertion: assertEqual
  expected-return: 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.9

Requirements:
  SaltStack master server with ability to control target servers
  * control can either be over ssh or the salt master event bus (e.g. zeromq)

Installation:
  pip install salt_check
